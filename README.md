# sqlalchemy_climate_analysis
To begin, use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. 

'USC00519281' is the most active station, according to the data, but when gathering the last 12 months of temperature observation data from the station, the lastest date on record is different than the date being used previously for the precipitation data.

The start date was completed two ways in the Visual Studio; 
    the 1st way compiles the Min, Max, and Avg temp for every single day from the start date to the last date of the data.
    the 2nd way finds the Min, Max, and Avg temp for range of days from the date given(start).
